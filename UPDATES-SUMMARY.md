## 📝 Notes

1. **User Data Collection:** Currently logs to console. You may want to integrate with a backend API to store this data in a database.

2. **PDF Paths:** Heritage View page references `/HARITAGE VIEW/downloads/chittorgarh-guide.pdf`. Ensure this path is correct in your deployment.

3. **Image Path:** Heritage View uses `/HARITAGE VIEW/downloads/chittorgarh.jpg.jpg` for the hero image. Verify this path exists.

4. **Downloads Page:** The original Downloads page still exists at `/downloads` but is no longer linked in navigation. You can keep it for direct access or remove it if not needed.

5. **Framer Motion:** The Heritage View page uses Framer Motion for animations. This is already imported in the project.
